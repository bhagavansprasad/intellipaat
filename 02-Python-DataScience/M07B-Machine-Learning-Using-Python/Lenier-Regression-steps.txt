Hereâ€™s a detailed pseudocode for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The goal of EDA is to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and structure of the data before applying any statistical models or algorithms.

### **Pseudocode for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
#### 1. **Import Necessary Libraries**
#### 2. **Load the Dataset**
    # Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
    # Display the first few rows of the dataset to ensure it loaded correctly

#### 3. **Understand the Structure of the Data**
    # Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns)
    # Display the column names
    # Check the data types of each column
    # Check for missing values in each column
    # Summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, min, max, etc.)
    # Summary statistics for categorical columns (unique values, frequency)
        # For each categorical column in df:
            # Print unique values and their frequencies
            
#### 4. **Handle Missing Data**
# Identify columns with missing values
    # Option 1: Drop rows with many missing values
    # Option 2: Drop columns with many missing values
    # Option 3: Impute missing values with mean/median/mode
        For each column in columns_with_missing:
            If column is numerical:
                Impute missing values with mean or median of the column
            Else if column is categorical:
                Impute missing values with mode of the column
#### 5. **Data Visualization**
    # Visualize the distribution of numerical features
        For each numerical column in df_cleaned:
            Plot histogram of the column
            Plot box plot of the column

    # Visualize the relationship between numerical features using pair plots

### **Explanation**

1. **Correlation Matrix**: 
   - The first step in detecting multicollinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the numerical features. If two features have a high correlation (e.g., above 0.8 or 0.9), they might exhibit multicollinearity.

2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**:
   - VIF measures how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to collinearity with other features. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 indicates problematic multicollinearity.

3. **Action on Multicollinearity**:
   - If you detect multicollinearity, you can either remove one of the correlated features, combine them, or use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. If you choose to keep them, it's important to be cautious during modeling as they may affect the model's performance and interpretation.

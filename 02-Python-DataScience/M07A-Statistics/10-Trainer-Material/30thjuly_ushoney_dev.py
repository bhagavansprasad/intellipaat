#**Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹**#
  # **Hope you all are doing great. This is Dev on this end, and I welcome you all in this session. Let's wait for few minutes, so that your peers can also join. We will be kicking off the session at 7:07 AM**

#**Background / Scenario**#


**US Honey Case Study**

**PREFACE**

  **In 2006, global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component of American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to `Colony Collapse Disorder`, a phenomenon of disappearing worker bees causing the remaining hive colony to collapse. Speculation to the cause of this disorder points to hive diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no overall consensus has been reached. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and demand in America from 1998 to 2021.**

#**OBJECTIVE**#

****Visualize how the honey production is changed over the year (1998 - 2021) in US****

#**QUESTION**#

**How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2016?**

**Over time, what are the major production trends been across the states?**

**Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production every year?**

**How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?**
